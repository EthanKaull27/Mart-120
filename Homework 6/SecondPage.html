        My Favorite Story:
        <br>
        An album by the artist: Childish Gambino created a screenplay to go along with the songs.
        It centers around a boy who lives off his dad's money. He soon finds out that his life is
        empty without concequence and love. The story unfolds in many dramatic ways.

    Here is a picture from the short film:
